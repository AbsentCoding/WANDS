                        <h5>
                           Hogsmead Station
                        </h5>
                            <p>
                                We catch up with our main cast at Hogsmead station shortly after they detrain from the Hogwarts Express. 
                                Our story follows Gwynevere, Genevieve, Oswin, Phoenix, Penelope, Hayward, Celesta, James, and Prune.
                                While at the station, some of the students kept their distance from the others. Penelope attempted to befriend Phoenix
                                but was met with her standoffish personality, she is aferall a really cool 11-year-old from America who smokes. 
                                Hayward and Oswin kept their distance from the others, seperate from each other at that. 
                                The Ollivander twins, Gen and Gwen, were attached at the hip. Gen was practicing her leviosa charm but Gwen became frustrated,
                                letting those around her know that her emotions affect her outer appearance. The group begins to make their way to the carriages
                                that will take them to the castle not knowing that as First Year students they are supposed to head down to the lake and take a short
                                boat ride across the lake to the castle. They eventually figure this out and make their way to the docks. At the docks, the young wizards
                                enter the boats in groups of two: Oswin and Celesta, Gwen and Gen, Penelope and Phoenix, James and Hayward. 
                            </p>
                        <h5>
                            Black Lake
                        </h5>
                            <p>
                                It was abeautiful night, the party was enjoying the boat ride under the light of a full moon when they were suddenly enveloped by darkness. 
                                After a short while, one of the students noticed that there were glowing circles in the water. Another student, Gweneviere, recognized that the glowing
                                entities were the eyes of Gryndelows, an aquatic magical creature. Gwen attempted to convey her findings with the rest of the group but it was too late. 
                                The Gryndelows shook the boats causing some of the students to fall into the water. They were eventually able to make it out of the water, but not without 
                                a scrath. Celesta was bitten while grappeling one of the tiny creatures. Shortly after, the darkness subsided and the boats continued on their way towards
                                the castle where they were met by one of the professors. Professor Minerva Mcgonnagal applied healing magic to Celesta and disappeared before the group could
                                ask her any further questions. So begins the story this installment of the Decorina's time at Hogwarts.
