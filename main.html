                of the Marauders and Voldemort's rise to power. How will our intrepid aventurers fair in this world? Will they find themselves in 
                embroiled by the events surrounding them or will they follow their own adventure? Let us dive in and see what happens.

                    Sunday September 1st 1974: Hogsmead Station
                </p>
                <p>
                    We catch up with our main cast at Hogsmead station shortly after they detrain from the Hogwarts Express. 
                    Our story follows Gwynevere, Genevieve, Oswin, Phoenix, Penelope, Hayward, Celesta, James, and Prune.
                    While at the station, some of the students kept their distance from the others. Penelope attempted to befriend Phoenix
                    but was met with her standoffish personality, she is aferall a really cool 11-year-old from America who smokes. 
                    Hayward and Oswin kept their distance from the others, seperate from each other at that. 
                    The Ollivander twins, Gen and Gwen, were attached at the hip. Gen was practicing her leviosa charm but Gwen became frustrated,
                    letting those around her know that her emotions affect her outer appearance. The group begins to make their way to the carriages
                    that will take them to the castle not knowing that as First Year students they are supposed to head down to the lake and take a short
                    boat ride across the lake to the castle. They eventually figure this out and make their way to the docks. At the docks, the young wizards
                    enter the boats in groups of two: Oswin and Celesta, Gwen and Gen, Penelope and Phoenix, James and Hayward.
